An implementation of a [multimodal transformer](https://aclanthology.org/W18-6441/) for English to Chinese Translation.

All code is written in pytorch. Credit to this [blog post](https://cuicaihao.com/the-annotated-transformer-english-to-chinese-translator/) which I used as my base model. I adapted it to include multimodal attention and incorprate spatial image features into translation.

I put together a quick model demo in a Google Colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/113z-JrH1ms8JCpNFCyYo2IjVsRnUoXCp#scrollTo=7y5ZJcX-_j0U) for anyone interested!
