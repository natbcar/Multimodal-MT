# Multimodal-MT

An implementation of a multimodal transformer (https://aclanthology.org/W18-6441/) for English to Chinese Translation.

All code is written in pytorch. Credit to this blog post https://cuicaihao.com/the-annotated-transformer-english-to-chinese-translator/ which I used as my base model. I adapted it to include visual cross attention and incorprate spatial image features into translation.
